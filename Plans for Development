COSC 471/571 with Dr. Krish Narayanan Fall '21
Project: Best-Book-Buy Online Bookstore

Plans for Development:
  Work will attempt to be split evenly between both team members. Our relevant experiences in database systems is similar, so we are 
  going to try and divy up project goals evenly based on time requirements and availability. 
  
Hosting:
  Hosting will be done locally using XAMPP, with the updated files needed to run the server always available in a github repo. This way,
  as long as the most recent version of the code is committed to the github repo, either team member will be able to download and run the
  server with the others' changes applied. This allows one team member to run the server locally on their machine, update some code, and then
  upload the code to the github repo where the other team member can then download them and repeat the process using the same XAMPP configuration.
